# node-red-contrib-azure-storage

A set of nodes for making various calls using the 'azure-storage' node.js library.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install node-red-contrib-azure-storage
```

## Usage

Should be fairly self explanatory. Better docs to follow.

See [Microsoft Azure Storage Client Library for node.js](http://azure.github.io/azure-storage-node/index.html) for more information.

For now, I've only implemented nodes useful to my use case.

## Note

This is currently still a work in progress. As you may see not all the API functionality has been covered yet.

Patches welcome.
